# OOD_AE2 Project

# Introduction:

The purpose of this project is to develop a basic calculator using object-oriented programming principles in Python. The calculator will make use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with tkinter, and be able to perform standard arithmetic tasks such as the standard real number field operations (viz. "+", "-", "*", and "/"), taking a base to a specified exponent, and calculating square roots.
